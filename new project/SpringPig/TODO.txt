This is a list of bugs that need to be fixed and other things that need to be done:
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Collisions when jumping into a block.
	Repro:
		1. Create a block that is higher than the player can normally jump (note this also occurs when colliding with smaller blocks while in the air)
		2. Move towards a block
		3. Jump
		4. Continue to push key in the direction of the block as you collide with it
	
	Expected:
		Player collides with the block and falls down
		
	Observed:
		Player sticks on the block where they collide, as long as the key is pressed down.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Toggleable buttons becoming unpressed when moving the a crate off them
	Repro:
		1. Create a toggleable button
		2. Create a crate
		3. Push the crate onto the button
		4. Continue pushing the crate such that the button is now underneith the player
		
	Expected:
		Button remains pushed when it transitions from being under the crate to under the player
	
	Observed:
		When the button transitions from being under the crate to under the player, it becomes unpushed.
